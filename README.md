*Engineered to dominate space through logic, prediction, and precision.*

---

## 🚀 Overview
`stellar-strike-ai` is a TL-Verilog implementation of a 3-ship control strategy for the **Makerchip Space Battle** competition. It fuses predictive targeting, adaptive defense, and smart navigation into one powerful system.

### ⚔️ Core Features
- **🎯 Predictive Firing:** Fires where enemies will be using velocity estimation.
- **🛡️ Energy-Based Defense:** Cloaks and shields activate at mid-energy levels.
- **🧠 Boundary-Aware Movement:** Ships stay within the playfield using safe acceleration.
- **🕹️ Full Compatibility:** Works with `showdown_lib.tlv` and Makerchip’s VIZ tools.

## 🧠 Strategy Design

### Ship Roles
| Ship | Role         | Logic Summary                             |
|------|--------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 0    | Striker      | Aggressive predictive firing              |
| 1    | Defender     | Focuses on shields and cloaking           |
| 2    | Navigator    | Manages movement to avoid destruction     |

### Decision Flow
```
1. Is enemy visible and uncloaked?
   └──> Predict future position
         └──> Fire in direction of intercept
2. If energy is mid (20–40):
   └──> Activate shield + cloak
3. If energy is low (<=20):
   └──> Move away from borders (prevent destruction)
```
